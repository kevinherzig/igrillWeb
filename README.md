# iGrillWeb
Web app to monitor output from iGrill

## What do you need to do?
What you need to do is install my fork of iGrillMon, and then you can access
this page online.  

Once you get iGrillMon up and running, go to http://igrillweb.herzig.net and
type in your bluetooth address to start monitoring.

You can see MY iGrill V2 with this link:  http://igrillweb.herzig.net/index.html?address=D4:81:CA:22:AB:97

## Help Wanted - HTML
If you're good with HTML and could take a shot at making the layout dynamic I'd 
really appreciate the help.  I'd like to make the gauges line up horizontally
when there is enough screen space such as on a desktop, but change to vertical
on a mobile device.
