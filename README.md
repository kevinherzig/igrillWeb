# iGrillWeb
Web app to monitor output from iGrill

## What do you need to do?
What you need to do is install my fork of iGrillMon, and then you can access
this page online.  

Once you get iGrillMon up and running, go to http://igrillweb.herzig.net and
type in your bluetooth address to start monitoring.
